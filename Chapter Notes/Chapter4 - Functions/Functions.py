# Passing lists to functions (unpacking)
"""
The * operator, when applied to an iterable argument in a function call,
unpacks its elements. The following code creates a five-element grades list, then uses the
expression *grades to unpack its elements as averageâ€™s arguments:
"""
grades = [88, 75, 96, 55, 83]
print(average(*grades))
